The main objective of this project is to identify the significant sentences of the text and add them to the summary. The summary obtained contains exact sentences from the original text using the Word Frequency algorithm.
It is based on the concept that words which occur more frequently are significant. Hence , the sentences containing highly frequent words are important.
Based on this ,the algorithm assigns scores to each sentence in the text. The top-ranked sentences make it to the summary.
